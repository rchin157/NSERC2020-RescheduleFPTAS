FPTAS implementation of the algorithm as proposed in the rescheduling paper.
 
Running with -m makes it so the program will ask for s_i values.

The jobs are to be supplied via txt file formatted as follows:

***
number of jobs
p_j e_j
.
.
.
p_j e_j
***

Each row is a job and will be internally numbered in order from 1 to n. A sample file containing the jobs outlined in the example is included.
There is an example testcase named mTypeInstance.

-----------------

Running without any arguments is the same as with -m except instead of asking for s_i values it will enumerate all valid combinations of s.
There is an example testcase named eTypeInstance.
The jobs are to be supplied via txt file formatted as above.

The project now includes an instance generator under the numericaltesting folder. Running the program located there will generate a variety of instances.
A testing script is also included in the main folder which can be run as follows:

./runtest.sh ./numericaltesting/instances/... 

where ... should be replaced with a specific instance file. Of course these files only exist after running the generator, however a new set can be generated by 
running it again as it will simple write over the old ones.
